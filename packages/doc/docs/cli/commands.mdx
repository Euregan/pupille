## `check`

Runs the Pupille checker. This command will make pupille go to each specified
URL, wait for the specified selectors (if any), and take a screenshot. If there
is any new URL, or if any existing screenshot doesn't match the new ones, the
command will return a non-zero exit code.

## `approve <tests>`

When running the `check` command locally, you will sometimes get new
screenshots, or a different result from the previous ones. If the changes are
expected, you will need to approve them. You always need to specify which tests
you want to approve. If you want to approve all of them at once, you can use the
shorthand `*`. Otherwise you can specify the list of test URLs you want to
approve by listing them, separated by a comma (`,`).
