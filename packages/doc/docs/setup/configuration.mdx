The configuration has to be specified in a `pupille.config.js` file, placed at
the root of your project.

## `baseUrl`

This property is mandatory. You have to define the base url pupille should
check. This allows you to specify different domains or ports depending on the
environment.

## `root`

This property is optional, and allows you to specify which folder pupille
screenshots should live in. Default value is `pupille`.

## `prepare`

This property is optional, and allows you to specify a function to be run before
each test. It should return a `Promise`, and takes a
[Page](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page) as the only parameter.

## `resolutions`

This property is optional, and allows you to specify which resolution(s) you
want the screenshots to be taken in. It is an array of a tuple containing the
width and the height. You can list as many resolutions as you want. Each
resolution will require a new page load. The default value is `[[1920, 1080]]`

## `tests`

The main section of the configuration is found under the `tests` property. It's
an array containing every page to be tested.

### `url`

This property is mandatory. It specifies the URL to be tested.

### `waitFor`

This property is optional, and is used to specify one or more selectors to wait
for before taking the screenshot. It is useful if you need Pupille to wait for
some asynchronous data to load before the page is ready. It can either be a
string or an array of strings.

### `prepare`

This property is optional, and allows you to specify a function to be run before
the test. It should return a `Promise`, and takes a
[Page](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page) as the only parameter.
