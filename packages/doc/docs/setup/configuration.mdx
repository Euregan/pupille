The configuration has to be specified in a `pupille.config.js` file,
placed at the root of your project.

## `tests`

The main section of the configuration is found under the `tests`
property. It's an array containing every page to be tested.

### `url`

Each test must contain a `url` property, specifying the URL to be
tested.

### `waitFor`

`waitFor` is an optional property, used to specify one or more selectors
to wait for before taking the screenshot. It is useful if you need
Pupille to wait for some asynchronous data to load before the page is
ready. It can either be a string or an array of strings.
