Pupille is a visual testing tool, running directly on your computer and CI server.

Unlike other solutions, nothing runs in the cloud, and there is no need for paying
a subscription.

## Setting up

### Install Pupille

Using the package manager of your choice:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm" values={[ { label: 'npm', value: 'npm' }, { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn' } ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

  ```shell
  npm install pupille
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

  ```shell
  yarn add pupille
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Set up your configuration

Create a `pupille.config.json` file with the following empty skeleton:

```json title="/pupille.config.json"
{
  tests: [
  ]
}
```

You can start adding the URLs you want to test like so:

```json title="/pupille.config.json"
{
  tests: [
    { url: "https://pupille.io" }
  ]
}
```

### Testing it out

Simply run `pupille open`:

```shell
npx pupille open
```

This will run the Pupille server on your machine, and open the Pupille GUI in
your browser. The configured URLs will be automatically checked once, and the
results will appear in the browser. You can then check the URLs at any time by
clicking the "Check" button in the page.
